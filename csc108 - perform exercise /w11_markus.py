"""Week 11 Perform - Part 2

This code is provided solely for the personal and private use of students 
taking the CSC108 course at the University of Toronto. Copying for purposes 
other than this use is expressly prohibited. All forms of distribution of 
this code, whether as given or with any changes, are expressly prohibited.

Sadia Sharmin, and Jacqueline Smith.

Complete the following steps:
(1) Below is a bubble_up function that takes 3 parameters: the list, a start 
    index, and an end index, and bubbles the items in that range. 
    We have started a function called bubble_down that takes the same 3 
    parameters but bubbles in the opposite direction. 
    Complete function bubble_down.
(2) Save your file after you make changes, and then run the file by
    clicking on the green Run button in Wing101. This will let you call your
    modified function in the shell. An asterisk * on the Wing101
    w11_markus.py tab indicates that modifications have NOT been saved.
(3) Test your function in the Wing101 shell by evaluating the examples from
    the docstring and confirming that the correct result is displayed.
(4) Test your function using different function arguments.
(5) When convinced that your function is correct, submit your modified
    file to MarkUs. You can find instructions on submitting a file to MarkUs
    in the Week *2* Perform on PCRS.
(6) Verify you have submit the right file to MarkUs by downloading it again
    and checking it is the one you meant to submit.
(7) We have also provided a checker test for you to run in MarkUs. Run this to 
    make sure your code passes a simple test case (the one from the docstring). 
    Note that we will run additional tests when we mark your submission.
